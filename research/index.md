Gene expression levels are precisely regulated during development - quantitative perturbations to this process are a frequent cause of both rare and common human disease. However, most experimental tools that have been applied to study gene are binary in nature. Therefore, the overall goal of the lab is to develop and apply tools to quantitatively perturb gene regulation to understand both basic mechanisms of gene regulation and how this goes awry in disease.

Much of the lab's work centers on transcription factors (TFs), proteins that bind to noncoding regulatory DNA such as enhancers and promoters to ensure the sufficient and timely production of RNA (or lack thereof). Work by us and others have highlighted TFs as particularly dosage-sensitive - quantitative changes of 50% or less in TF levels frequent cause rare disorders or common variation in human trait and disease risk.

## Areas of focus

{% capture text %}

In addition to being dosage-sensitive, TFs are pleiotropic - they have important roles in multiple cell types and contexts. Despite these broad roles, TF dosage sensitivity often manifests in one or a handful of cell types - why this specificity. To address this question, we study the human neural crest, a transient, embryonic cell population that gives rise to a fascinating array of cell types and tissues. By understanding why specific neural crest lineages are sensitive to dosage of broadly important TFs, we will yield new insights into developmental disorders that affect organ systems as diverse as the face, as in craniofacial malformations, and the gut, such as the loss of the enteric nervous system in Hirschsprung's disease.
