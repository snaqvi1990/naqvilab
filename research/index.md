Gene expression levels are precisely regulated during development and quantitative perturbations to this process are a frequent cause of both rare and common human disease. However, most experimental tools that have been applied to study gene are binary in nature. Therefore,  a key goal of the lab is to develop and apply tools to quantitatively perturb gene regulation to understand both basic mechanisms of gene regulation and how this goes awry in disease.

Much of the lab's work centers on transcription factors (TFs), proteins that bind to noncoding regulatory DNA such as enhancers and promoters and drive changes in chromatin state and transcription itself to ultimately ensure the sufficient and timely production of RNA.
