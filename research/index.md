Gene expression levels are precisely regulated during development - quantitative perturbations to this process are a frequent cause of both rare and common human disease. However, most experimental tools that have been applied to study gene are binary in nature. Therefore, the overall goal of the lab is to develop and apply tools to quantitatively perturb gene regulation to understand both basic mechanisms of gene regulation and how this goes awry in disease.

Much of the lab's work centers on transcription factors (TFs), proteins that bind to noncoding regulatory DNA such as enhancers and promoters to ensure the sufficient and timely production of RNA (or lack thereof). Work by us and others have highlighted TFs as particularly dosage-sensitive - quantitative changes of 50% or less in TF levels frequent cause rare disorders or common variation in human trait and disease risk.

## Areas of focus

{% capture text %}

In addition to being dosage-sensitive, TFs are often pleiotropic - they have important roles in multiple cell types and contexts. Nevertheless, despite these broad roles, TF dosage sensitivity (i.e. the effect of 50% reduction) often manifests in only one or a handful of these cell types. To understand the mechanisms underlying this cell type specificity, we are combining directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells with quantitative dosage modulation. We use human neural crest cells as a model, as this transient, embryonic cell population can give rise to an array of cell types and tissues including the face and the gut nervous system.
