Sachi is a research assistant within the Naqvi Lab. She just graduated this past June from UCLA with a major in Physiological Sciences and a minor in Global Health. Throughout undergrad, she worked on reprogramming induced pluripotent stem cells into active retinal pigment epithelium cells at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center. Outside of the lab, she loves finding new restaurants to add to her Beli, doing yoga, and exploring Boston (first time on the east coast!).
