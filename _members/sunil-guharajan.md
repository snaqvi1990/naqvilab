A transcription factor (TF) enthusiast with a passion for understanding how these regulatory molecules are implicated in development, differentiation, and disease. I completed my PhD at UMass Chan Medical School under the tutelage of Robert Brewster, where I used a combination of synthetic biology and thermodynamic modeling to understand how changes in promoter architecture shape the function of E.coli TFs. My current research interests aim to identify how TFs shape cellular decisions through contextual, selective use of gene regulatory elements, with the goal of understanding how this computation is susceptible to quantitative changes in TF dosage across different cell types. To tackle this question, I aim to employ complementary approaches that include chemical and genetic perturbations of TFs and high-resolution mapping of enhancer usage. When I am not in lab troubleshooting experiments, you can find me outside (if New England weather permits) hiking or indoors exploring my hopefully latent culinary potential.
